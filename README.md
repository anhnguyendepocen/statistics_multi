by Ralf B. Schäfer, University of Koblenz-Landau 2018/19

## Overview

This repository provides all course materials including R code, slides and data.
For further information such as links to teaching videos visit the OpenOlat course pages.

### Prerequisites

To prepare your computer for the lecture, you need to install [R](http://www.r-project.org/),
[Revolution R](http://mran.revolutionanalytics.com/download/) or [R Studio](http://www.rstudio.com/).
I use several packages in the course, if you want to have all packages ready at the beginning of the course, run the script 0_install_packgs.R
in the Code folder. Note that these are all my packages that I use for different projects and installation may take some time. 
Alternatively, you can just install a new package whenever it is needed:

```
install.packages("package_name")
```
