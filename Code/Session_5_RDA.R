# we first set a working directory i.e. a directory where we store all files
setwd("~/Gitprojects/Teaching/Statistics_multi/Code")
# you have to set a path to a working directory on your local machine here
# to simplify the identification of your path, you can use the following function
file.choose()
# and select a file in your desired working directory. Subsequently, copy the path
# without (!!!) the file reference into the setwd function

# parts of the code of this script
# have been adapted from Borcard et al. 2011
# and Zuur et al. 2007

# Here we are interested in species with a strong relationship with the environmental gradient,
# consequently we remove species that occur at 4 or less of the 24 sites.
# Compare the discussion on the removal of rare species in the literature:
# Cao, Y.; Larsen, D. P.; Thorne, R. S., Rare species in multivariate analysis for bioassessment:
# some considerations. J. N. Am. Benthol. Soc. 2001, 20, (1), 144-153.
# Marchant, R., Do rare species have any place in multivariate analysis for bioassessment?
# J. N. Am. Benthol. Soc. 2002, 21, (2), 311-313.
# Rare species may especially cause problems in Correspondence Analysis and Canonical Correspondence Analysis
# In this analysis, we remove them primarily to simplify the data set

# presence-absence transformation to calculate species number per site
varespec_pa <- decostand(varespec, "pa")
# calculate sum per species
vare_sum <- apply(varespec_pa, 2, sum)
sort(vare_sum)

# removal of rare species

# remove species that occur at less than 5 sites
varespec_fin <- varespec[, !vare_sum < 5]

sort(apply(varespec_fin, 2, max))
# strong differences in order of magnitude of species abundances
sort(apply(varespec_fin, 2, sd))
# species with highest abundances also dominate the variation
# without standardisation (which includes mean centering and standardisation to unit variance)
# the analysis would be dominated by the species with the highest variation
# We can standardise the data directly within the rda command (see below)

# now we look at the environmental variables
data(varechem)
head(varechem)
# environmental data from soils

# collinearity may hamper interpretation of the RDA with respect to the relevance of individual variables
# we therefore check for collinearity
# note that we could also conduct a PCA and work with orthogonal environmental variables,
# though this does not necessarily simplify interpretation

# please refer to the part on multiple linear regression on methods to deal with multicollinearity

# checking gradient length with detrended correspondence analysis
decorana(varespec_fin)
# gives the average standard deviation
# a completely unimodal gradient has approximately 4 SD
# linear analyses are presumably ok for SD up to 2-3

# check whether Hellinger transformation decreases gradient length

# since we did not standardise before, we should scale the variables
# this implies that changes in species abundances obtain equal consideration
# if we had used the hellinger transformation, we would not need to scale

# we obtain 11 RDA (constrained) and 12 PCA (unconstrained) axes.
# Further PCA axes are not displayed as their eigenvalues are too small
# and would exceed the number of observations

# 53% explained by environmental variables
# first two axes explain 22% of total variation
# and 22/53 (~42%) of constrained variation

# species scores represent the position of species on the axis in bi- or triplots
# site scores give the coordinates of sites in the space of the species (response)
# site constraints give the coordinates of sites in the space of the environmental variables (explanatory)
# biplot scores give the coordinates for the environmental variable arrows

var_rda_test <- rda(varespec ~., data = varechem_fin, scale = TRUE)

# Triplots of the rda results #
###############################

# we compare two commonly used scalings

# Scaling 1: distance triplot

arrows(0, 0, var.sc[, 1], var.sc[, 2], length = 0, lty = 1, col = "red")
# lines for species can be omitted

# How to interpret this plot?
# Zuur et al 2007, page 211 give the following rules (content modified by RBS):
# 1. Sites can be projected perpendicularly on the species or explanatory lines
#    and approximate the fitted value of the site along the variable
# 2. Distances between sites represent a two-dimensional approximation
#    of their fitted Euclidean distances.
# 3. Angles between lines of species and explanatory variables reflect their correlation.
# 4. Angles between lines for species or explanatory variables do not represent correlations.
# an additional technical explanation is given in Legendre & Legendre 2012: 639-641

# Scaling 2 (default): correlation triplot

plot(var_rda, main = "Triplot RDA scaling 2 - wa scores")
var2.sc <- scores(var_rda, choices = 1:2, display = "sp")
arrows(0, 0, var2.sc[, 1], var2.sc[, 2], length = 0, lty = 1, col = "red")
# lines for species can be omitted

# 1. Sites can be projected perpendicularly on lines (species or explanatory)
#    indicating the values of the species or explanatory variables at those sites.
# 2. Distances between sites cannot be compared directly with each other.
# 3. All angles between lines reflect their correlation.
#    But these are not as accurate as the ones obtained by a PCA of the explanatory variables.
# 4. Length of lines is not important

# better be expressed as linear combinations of the explanatory variables:

vignette("decision-vegan", package = "vegan")
# and compare to Borcard et al. 163-164

# RDA and model building #
#########################

# the model building frameworks of the linear and generalized linear models in R
# can also be used in the case of RDA
# This makes sense if the purpose is to identify the most important variables
# and the most parsimonious RDA model

# Forward selection using the adj. R2 as goodness of fit measure
step_both_R2 <- ordiR2step(rda(varespec_fin ~ Al, data = varechem_fin), scope = formula(var_rda), direction = "both", pstep = 1000)
# this yields a best-fit model consisting of Al + P + N + Baresoil
# Note that the stepwise function has several stopping criteria:
# 1. adj r2 decreases
# 2. adj r2 would exceed that of the model defined in the scope
# this can be checked with RsquareAdj(var_rda)
# 3. exceeding selected p-value

# Background on the data - taken from Zuur et al. 2007:
# Sea level rise may affect the ecology of the Dutch coastal system
# The Dutch governmental institute RIKZ therefore started a research project
# on the relationship between some abiotic aspects
# (e.g., sediment composition, slope of the beach) and the benthic fauna.
# NAP is the height of the sampling station relative to the mean tidal level.
# Exposure is an index that is composed of the following elements:
# wave action, length of the surf zone, slope, grain size and the depth of the anaerobic layer.
# Humus constitutes the amount of organic material.
