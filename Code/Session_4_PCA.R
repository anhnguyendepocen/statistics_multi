# PC6 is minor and consequently 5 PCs could be selected based on the plot

# third component slightly lower than broken stick criterion
# broken stick for individual PCs and cumulative variance provided in the following library:

# PCA axes with a higher percentage of (accumulated) variance than the broken-stick variance are regarded as svignificant.

## illustration of broken stick model in R
# we look at the case for p = 2, i.e. the stick is broken into 2 pieces
p <- 2
# we determine the length of the longest piece y for a random breaking of a stick of unit length,
# hence we sample from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1.
# If the selected value y is larger than 0.5, we keep it, otherwise 1-y would be the longest piece
target_vec <- c(1:10000)
# repeat 10000 times
# set seed for reproducible example

for (i in 1:length(target_vec)) {

}

# if else rule as outlined above

# read chapter 3 in the following document
# to understand the impact of axis scaling
vegandocs("decision-vegan")
# Borcard (2011, p.121) states: "Bottom line: if the main interest of the analysis is
# to interpret the relationships among objects [here sites, RBS ], choose scaling 1.
# If the main interest focuses on the relationships among descriptors [here env. variables, RBS ], choose scaling 2"
# scaling = 3 represents a compromise, but note that both objects and descriptors are not presented with original distances/correlations

# Extraction of PC scores    #

# here we select 4 axes
pca_axes <- vegan::scores(va_pca, disp = "sites", choices = c(1:ncol(varechem)), scaling = 0)
# scaling depends on whether we focus on sites or variables, 0 means raw scares (not scaled)
# we can address the axes as usually
pca_axes[, 1:4]

# The first PCs preserve what is common in the data, not necessarily what predicts
# a gradient in an external data set (or what differentiates groups)
# Especially when the aim is prediction, this may lead to problems, if only
# the first axes are included in the analysis as later axes may still be important
# see discussion in Jolliffe (2002), p173f. An example is discussed where the PCs 8 and 10
# bear almost no variance (3 and < 1 %) but are among the most important predictors
# for a response variable

# also have a look at this blog:
